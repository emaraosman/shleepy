# shleepy
An interactive software designed to help induce sleep through cognitive shuffling.

User Story: 
-Presented with welcome screen and welcome button to enter site
-User presses welcome button and enters game screen
-On game screen, a prompt at the top instructs user to pick from the many buttons visible
-Each button containing a word, user chooses one and proceeds to next game screen
-On game screen 2 user is presented with chosen word at the top of the page, and input field below
-User inputs a word beginning with letter highlighted above
-After accepting an input a button appears with a text of ‘next’ which creates 3 second timer/freeze and next blank input field
-User repeats previous 2 steps until desired and moves on to “done” button which highlights next letter above
-Previous 4 steps continue until desired completion time.

Structure
I expect to have a lot of difficulty with the placement of the text on the screen, and getting each letter to move into corresponding positions.

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
